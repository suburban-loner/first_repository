                        <p>
                            I am a prospective Software Engineer that is currently studying at HyperionDev.
                            I am an energetic, disciplined, responsible, and hard-working person. I am a fast learner and adaptive to challenging situations. 
                            I am to work under pressure and can adhere to strict schedule. My motivations for learning to program is to be able to make something, that I 
                            imagined making, from nothing, seeing the other side of websites and application than what I've always seen as a consumer and 
                            finding out how things work has always interested me. I would like to be Software Engineer in some espect whether it be as a 
                            Data Engineer, DevOps Engineer, Back-End Engineer, or as a Software Engineer itself.
